**How It Works**

1. **Input Grades:** The user can input grades for multiple subjects or assignments. If the user inputs "done," the program ends input collection.
2. **Validation:** Grades must be between 0 and 100. Invalid inputs prompt the user to try again.
3. **Calculation:**
      The program calculates the average grade.
      It determines the corresponding letter grade and GPA.
4. **Output:**
        Displays grades for all entered subjects.
        Shows the overall average, letter grade, and GPA.
